HMMBOX, version 4.1, Iead Rezek, Oxford University, July 2001
Matlab toolbox for Variational estimation Hidden Markov Models. 

(Adapted from Hidden Markov Toolbox Version 3.3  01-Apr-99 and 
Coupled Hidden Markov  Toolbox Version 1.1  01-Feb-01

The software uses some NETLAB routines
(see http://neural-server.aston.ac.uk/netlab/index.html
so you'll need to have NETLAB on your search path

See the file VERSION for what's new in this version.

The observation models has so far been implemented are 
Gaussian, Poisson and Dirichlet

DEMONSTRATIONS:

demgausschmm.m       uses Gaussian observation model on AR features

To extend the CHMM to different observation models add the required
code into cobsinit, obslike and obsupdate.
